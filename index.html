            <p>I grew up in Idaho Falls, Idaho for most of my childhood, but am currently living in Rexburg, Idaho. I am a student at 
                Brigham Young University - Idaho studying Computer Science with a minor in Computer Engineering. I am happily married 
                to my beautiful bride, Brooklyne. We met while we were at Bonneville Highschool and started to date our Senior year. 
                We have a puppy named sky that we are obsessed with and is a handful right now. She is an Australian Shepherd so she 
                is full of energy! I am excited to be able to go on jogs with her when she gets older. I served a mission for the Church
                of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Austin, Texas and had such an amazing experience. I learned so much about how to
                live life and even more about myself. I love to do anything outdoors, but two of my favorites are hiking and fishing. I 
                also enjoy playing basketball since I played on my highschool basketball team and I can also pick up almost any other 
                sport and play hard. </p>
